# Coding-final-project

Final project for the Computer Literacy Bootcamp.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates basic image processing in Python, including:
- Reading a grayscale PNG image (`tree.png`)
- Applying a Gaussian blur
- Plotting grayscale histograms for both the original and blurred images
- Performing a statistical comparison using a t-test
- Saving both a blurred version and a downscaled version of the image
